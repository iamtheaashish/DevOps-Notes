There are a total of 4,294,967,296 unique IPv4 addresses available
 in the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addressing scheme. 
This number is derived from the fact that IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, allowing for 2^32 possible combinations.

There are a total of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 unique
IPv6 addresses available in the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addressing scheme.
This number is derived from the fact that IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers, allowing for 2^128 possible combinations.

+ Having to look for the IP address when you want to visit
- a webpage will take a lifetime.
+ So we just type in the domain name we're familiar with
- and let the magical system that is the DNS to take care
- of the rest :)

< What happens when you type a URL (let's say google.com)in a browser and hit enter? >
1. For each website, there is a unique IP address that identifies it. No one can remember IP addresses, 
2. So we use domain names instead. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates these domain names into IP addresses.
3. DNS remembers the mappings between domain names and IP addresses, allowing for quick and easy access to websites.
4. Browser needs two things hostname/domain name and IP address to establish a connection. google.com ----> IP address
5. Browser will talk to DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address. It converts hostname into IP address and IP address into hostname.
6. First Browser will talk to local DNS server.
```A local DNS server is usually provided by whichever system is managing your internet connection. Depending on your setup, it can come from different sources:

Your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
By default, most devices are assigned the ISP's DNS servers automatically through DHCP.
Example: Reliance Jio, Airtel, BSNL, etc., in India provide their own DNS servers.

Your Router / Home Network Gateway
Your Wi-Fi router often acts as a local DNS forwarder.
It doesn't resolve queries itself but forwards them to the ISP's DNS or a custom DNS you configure (like Google DNS or Cloudflare).
Devices on the network see the router as their "local DNS server."

Your Operating System / Local Machine
Some OSes run a stub resolver or DNS caching service (e.g., systemd-resolved on Linux, DNS Client service on Windows, mDNSResponder on macOS).
These are not full DNS servers but cache and forward queries.

Custom / Enterprise Setup
In organizations, the local DNS server is often provided by the company's internal DNS infrastructure (like Windows Active Directory DNS servers or BIND/Unbound).
This allows internal hostnames and domain resolution. ```
7. If the local DNS server does not have the IP address cached, Browser will talk to the rootname DNS server.
8. Rootname DNS server will identify how your domain name ends (e.g., .com, .org, .in etc). 
# .com is top level domain, .in is top level domain, .org is top level domain.
# in .com itself there are millions of domains.
9. The query is then forwarded to the appropriate TLD (TOP LEVEL DOMAIN) DNS server.
10. In TLD DNS server, there is a 'Name Server' that will identify the domain name "google.com".
# Name Server will identify what we are requesting for.
11. Name Server will go to SOA (Start of Authority) record to get the authoritative DNS server for "google.com".
# SOA has all the IP addresses in the name server. He is like a admin of google.com. All the IP addresses that belong to google.com are listed there.
# SOA record will provide the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for "google.com".
12. SOA will give IP address to local DNS server
