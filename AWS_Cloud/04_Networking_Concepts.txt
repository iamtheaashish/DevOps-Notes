< PROTOCOLS >
#https://google.com
- Protocol://hostname:port/ 
- HTTP= Hyper Text Transfer Protocol -  It is transfers data to and fro from website to browser, it is a protocol.
- HTTPS = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secured - It is transfers data to and fro from website to browser, it is a protocol.
- HTTP= 80 , HTTPS= 443 default ports so no need to mention, but they port numbers can be customized.
* If application is working on some other port like 8080 so you'll have to mention it like https://aashish.com:8080 even though the default port is 443 for HTTPS.

$ HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTP is not secured. It can be hacked easily. HTTPS is secured. It uses SSL certificate to encrypt the data.
Man in the Middle Attack (MitM) is a security breach where a third party intercepts the communication between two parties without their knowledge. 
HTTP is vulnerable to MitM attacks, while HTTPS provides a secure communication channel that protects against such attacks.
While doing payment transactions, it is crucial to use HTTPS to ensure that sensitive information, such as credit card details, is transmitted securely and cannot be intercepted by malicious actors.
If they are using HTTP, it is a red flag and you should avoid making payments on such websites.

# Example: 404 Page not Found
< These are HTTP Status Codes >
1. 404 - Not Found
2. 200 - OK - succes code, Page Found
3. 500 - Internal Server Error
4. 403 - Forbidden
5. 301 - Moved Permanently
6. 400 - Bad Request
7. 401 - Unauthorized
8. 402 - Payment Required
9. 405 - Method Not Allowed
10. 408 - Request Timeout
11. 429 - Too Many Requests
12. 511 - Network Authentication Required
13. 418 - I'm a teapot
14. 503 - Service Unavailable
There are many many status codes, we don't need to remember all of them, but we should know the common ones like 404, 200, 500, 403, 301, etc.
==========
< TCP - Transmission Control Protocol > it is reliable
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is established between the client and server before data is transmitted.
TCP ensures that data is delivered in the same order in which it was sent, and it also provides error-checking mechanisms to ensure that data is not corrupted during transmission.

`HTTP carries data over TCP/IP. When you type a URL in your browser`
The browser sends an HTTP request to the server over a TCP connection.
The server then responds with an HTTP response, which is also sent over the same TCP connection.

+ HTTP works in Application Layer of OSI Model, while TCP works in Transport Layer of OSI Model. +
==========
< UDP - User Datagram Protocol > it is unreliable
UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means that data is sent without establishing a connection between the client and server.
UDP does not guarantee the order of data delivery, and it also does not provide error-checking mechanisms.

`DNS uses UDP for its queries. When you type a URL in your browser`

The browser sends a DNS query to the DNS server over a UDP connection.
The DNS server then responds with the IP address of the requested domain, which is also sent over the same UDP connection.
==========
Both TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols that are used to transmit data over the internet. However, they have different characteristics and are used for different purposes.

Basic networking can't replace the need of understanding whole networking from Behrouz A. Forouzan's book "Data Communications and Networking with TCP/IP Protocol Suite".
