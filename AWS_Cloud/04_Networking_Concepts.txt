< PROTOCOLS >
#https://google.com
- Protocol://hostname:port/ 
- HTTP= Hyper Text Transfer Protocol -  It is transfers data to and fro from website to browser, it is a protocol.
- HTTPS = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secured - It is transfers data to and fro from website to browser, it is a protocol.
- HTTP= 80 , HTTPS= 443 default ports so no need to mention, but they port numbers can be customized.
* If application is working on some other port like 8080 so you'll have to mention it like https://aashish.com:8080 even though the default port is 443 for HTTPS.

$ HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTP is not secured. It can be hacked easily. HTTPS is secured. It uses SSL certificate to encrypt the data.
Man in the Middle Attack (MitM) is a security breach where a third party intercepts the communication between two parties without their knowledge. 
HTTP is vulnerable to MitM attacks, while HTTPS provides a secure communication channel that protects against such attacks.
While doing payment transactions, it is crucial to use HTTPS to ensure that sensitive information, such as credit card details, is transmitted securely and cannot be intercepted by malicious actors.
If they are using HTTP, it is a red flag and you should avoid making payments on such websites.
