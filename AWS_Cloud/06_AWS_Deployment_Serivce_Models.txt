#This note is about AWS Deployment Service Models.
AWS has datacenters across the world, allowing for low-latency access to applications and data.
* We moved from physical servers to virtual servers to cloud instances.
- On top of virtual servers, we have hypervisors on which guest machines or virtual machines are installed.
- These virtual machines can run different operating systems and applications independently.
- Cloud providers like AWS manage the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus on their applications.
- This abstraction enables scalability, flexibility, and efficient resource utilization.
=========================================================================================
`What is Infrastructure ?`

Infrastructure refers to the underlying physical and virtual resources that support the delivery of IT services. This includes:

1. **Physical Infrastructure**: The tangible components such as servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and data centers.

2. **Virtual Infrastructure**: The abstracted resources created by virtualization technologies, including virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage.

3. **Cloud Infrastructure**: The combination of physical and virtual resources provided by cloud service providers like AWS, enabling on-demand access to computing resources over the internet.

In summary, infrastructure encompasses all the foundational elements required to build, deploy, and manage applications and services in a computing environment.    
=======================
AWS is infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider.
- AWS has a lot of Data Centers around the world.
- In India, AWS has data centers in cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad, providing low-latency access to applications and data for users in the region.
- Cloud infrastructure is designed to be highly scalable, allowing businesses to easily adjust their resources based on demand.
- AWS offers a variety of services, including computing, storage, and databases, all accessible through its cloud infrastructure.
- Security is a top priority for AWS, with multiple layers of protection in place to safeguard customer data.
- Cloud is present in the remote location (Data center) and can be accessed over the internet, providing flexibility and scalability for businesses.

* We need network to connect to the cloud.
=======================
"Why they named it as CLOUD?"
They named it cloud because it represents a vast, interconnected network of servers and resources that are accessible over the internet,
much like how clouds in the sky are expansive and omnipresent. The term "cloud" conveys the idea of a flexible, scalable, and on-demand computing environment
where users can access and utilize resources without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.
Just as clouds can change shape and size, cloud computing allows for dynamic allocation of resources based on user needs.

"What is Computing?"
Computing refers to the process of using computer technology to complete a task locally. 
It involves the manipulation of data and the execution of algorithms to solve problems or perform specific functions locally.

There are several key aspects of computing:
1. **Hardware**: The physical components of a computer system, including the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices.

2. **Software**: The programs and applications that run on computer hardware, enabling users to perform tasks and access information.

3. **Networking**: The connections between computers and devices that allow for communication and data exchange.

4. **Data**: The information processed and stored by computer systems, which can be analyzed and used to make decisions.
In summary, computing encompasses the entire ecosystem of technology that enables the processing and management of information.

"What is Cloud Computing?"
Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources over the internet on an as-needed basis.
It allows users to access and utilize a shared pool of configurable computing resources, 
such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, without the need for direct management by the user.

Instead of computing locally on your machine, cloud computing is simply doing computing remotely on the cloud (data center ) over the internet.

Key characteristics of cloud computing include:
1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision computing resources automatically without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

2. **Broad Network Access**: Cloud services are accessible over the internet from a variety of devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

3. **Resource Pooling**: Cloud providers pool their resources to serve multiple customers, dynamically allocating and reallocating resources as needed.

4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Cloud resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet changing demand, providing flexibility for users.

5. **Measured Service**: Cloud providers offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing users to pay only for the resources they consume.
Cloud computing enables organizations to focus on their core business activities while leveraging the scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of cloud services.
=======================
AWS uses Xen hypervisor technology to provide virtualization for its cloud services.
Xen is an open-source hypervisor that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, enabling efficient resource utilization and isolation between different workloads.
This technology is a key component of AWS's infrastructure, allowing it to deliver scalable and reliable cloud services to its customers.

It uses 2 models: 
- Deployment Model
1. Public Cloud - Offered to multiple customers over the internet. Service are accessed by everyone.
2. Private Cloud - Dedicated to a single organization, providing more control and security. Services are accessed by a single organization.
3. Hybrid Cloud - Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Services are accessed by multiple organizations.    --- It is a technique, there is no separate cloud for hybrid.
4. Community Cloud - Same as Private Cloud but shared by several organizations with similar requirements. Services are accessed by a specific community of users.   --- It is also a technique, there is no separate cloud for community.

`AWS is a public cloud provider which provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).`

- Service Model
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networks.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Offers a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS) - Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access applications via a web browser without installation.
4. Anything as a Service (XaaS) - Refers to the delivery of any IT function or service over the internet, allowing organizations to consume resources on-demand and pay only for what they use.
