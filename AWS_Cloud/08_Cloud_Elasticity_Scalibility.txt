# This note is about Elasticity and Scalability in AWS, their merits and demerits. Thanks to Reyaz Sir and Shaik Ashish.
# Elasticity and Scalability are two important concepts in cloud computing that refer to the ability of a system to adapt to changing workloads and demands.

```On Premises setting up things like networking, database, and servers can be complex and time-consuming. 
In contrast, AWS provides a more streamlined approach to these tasks, allowing users to focus on their applications rather than the underlying infrastructure. 
Hours and Days have reduced to Minutes and Seconds because of AWS.```

$ Possible Risks of Using CLOUD: 
1. Security and Privacy Concerns: because you can't access your infrastructure without connecting to internet.
-  Your critical data is with the cloud provider. Although AWS is very secure, Security Breaches can be costly.
2. Lock In: The proprietary nature of cloud services can make it difficult to migrate to another provider or back to on-premises infrastructure.
- It creates long term dependency on the cloud provider's tools and services, making it challenging to switch providers or adopt new technologies.
3. Isolation Failure: this risk involves the failure of isolation mechanisms that separate different customers' data and applications within a shared cloud environment.
4. Management Interface Compromise: In case of cloud provider, the customer Management interfaces are accessible over the internet.
- This can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches if not properly secured.
5. Insecure or Incomplete Data Deletion: When data is deleted from the cloud, it may not be completely removed from all storage locations.
- This can result in data remnants being accessible, posing a risk to sensitive information.

< Elasticity aka Horizontal Scaling > Adding new new new servers.
 Elasticity is the ability of a cloud service to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.
 AWS provides various services like Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to help achieve elasticity.
 This means that during peak usage times, additional resources can be provisioned automatically, and during low usage times, resources can be scaled back down.
 Benefits of elasticity include cost savings, improved performance, and the ability to handle varying workloads without manual intervention.

 # Amazon.in has Great Indian Festival sale, more number of people will visit the website on that perticular day.
 # AWS can automatically scale resources to handle the increased traffic during the sale. Scale Out
 # After the sale, AWS can scale resources back down to save costs. Scale In
 # Overall we call this Elasticity. You can achieve elasticity using Auto Scaling.

 < Scalability aka Vertical Scaling > Increasing the capacity of existing servers CPU RAM etc.
 Scalability is the ability of a cloud service to handle increased workloads by adding resources, either vertically (scaling up) or horizontally (scaling out).
 AWS offers services like Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon RDS Read Replicas to help achieve scalability.
 Vertical scaling involves adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing instance, while horizontal scaling involves adding more instances to distribute the load.
 Benefits of scalability include the ability to accommodate growth, improved application performance, and better resource utilization.

- Both can be achieved with minimal effort. Both can be either long term or short term.
- It's a matter of few clicks for both.
