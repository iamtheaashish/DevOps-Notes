# This note is about Elasticity and Scalability in AWS, their merits and demerits. Thanks to Reyaz Sir and Shaik Ashish.
# Elasticity and Scalability are two important concepts in cloud computing that refer to the ability of a system to adapt to changing workloads and demands.

```On Premises setting up things like networking, database, and servers can be complex and time-consuming. 
In contrast, AWS provides a more streamlined approach to these tasks, allowing users to focus on their applications rather than the underlying infrastructure. 
Hours and Days have reduced to Minutes and Seconds because of AWS.```

$ Possible Risks of Using CLOUD: 
1. Security and Privacy Concerns: because you can't access your infrastructure without connecting to internet.
-  Your critical data is with the cloud provider. Although AWS is very secure, Security Breaches can be costly.
2. Lock In: The proprietary nature of cloud services can make it difficult to migrate to another provider or back to on-premises infrastructure.
- It creates long term dependency on the cloud provider's tools and services, making it challenging to switch providers or adopt new technologies.
3. Isolation Failure: this risk involves the failure of isolation mechanisms that separate different customers' data and applications within a shared cloud environment.
4. Management Interface Compromise: In case of cloud provider, the customer Management interfaces are accessible over the internet.
- This can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches if not properly secured.
5. Insecure or Incomplete Data Deletion: When data is deleted from the cloud, it may not be completely removed from all storage locations.
- This can result in data remnants being accessible, posing a risk to sensitive information.
