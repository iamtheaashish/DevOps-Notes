< Amazon EC2 ~ Elastic Compute Cloud >

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
It allows users to launch and manage virtual servers, known as instances, on-demand. 
EC2 offers a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and GPU instances. 
Users can choose the operating system, instance type, and storage options to meet their specific requirements.

Key features of Amazon EC2 include:

1. **Scalability**: EC2 allows users to scale their compute resources up or down based on demand. 
* This elasticity enables businesses to handle varying workloads efficiently.

2. **Pay-as-you-go Pricing**: With EC2, users only pay for the compute capacity they use. 
* This cost-effective model eliminates the need for upfront investments in hardware.

3. **Security**: EC2 provides multiple layers of security, including virtual private clouds (VPCs),
* security groups, and key pairs for secure access to instances.

4. **Integration with Other AWS Services**: EC2 seamlessly integrates with other AWS services,
* such as Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon RDS for databases, and AWS Lambda for serverless computing.

5. **Customizable**: Users can choose from a wide range of instance types, operating systems, and
* software configurations to create a tailored environment for their applications.

Overall, Amazon EC2 is a powerful and flexible compute service that enables businesses to run applications in the cloud with ease.

* We launch instances(like virtual machines) in EC2. It is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

" Load Balancer in EC2: "
- On premises, load balancer setup will take a lot of time. In AWS we call it ( Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)). 
- It distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.
- ELB automatically scales its request handling capacity in response to incoming traffic.
- ELB is completely managed by AWS(HA, Performance Auto Scaling). No need to create multiple load balancers manually.
- No need to worry about auto-scaling of ELB.
- ELB is a service not a server for us. You can't login to ELB but you can access ELB.

< Elastic BeanStalk > Platform as a Service (PaaS) ~ "Easy and quick deployment of applications"
Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in the cloud.
It abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the details of the environment.

1. **Simplified Deployment**: 
* Elastic Beanstalk automates the deployment process, handling tasks such as capacity provisioning, load balancing, and application health monitoring.

2. **Support for Multiple Languages and Frameworks**: Elastic Beanstalk supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

3. **Customizable Environment**:
* While Elastic Beanstalk manages the infrastructure, developers can still customize the environment by configuring settings, adding environment variables, and using custom Docker containers.                      

4. **Monitoring and Management**: 
* Elastic Beanstalk provides built-in monitoring and management tools, allowing developers to track application performance, view logs, and make adjustments as needed.

< Amazon LIGHTSAIL > Simplified cloud hosting

Amazon Lightsail is a simplified cloud platform that offers virtual private servers (VPS), storage, and networking capabilities. It is designed for developers, small businesses, and startups who need an easy-to-use solution for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.

1. **Easy-to-Use Interface**: 
* Lightsail provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of launching and managing instances.

2. **Preconfigured Application Stacks**: Lightsail offers preconfigured application stacks, making it easy to deploy popular applications like WordPress, Joomla, and Magento with just a few clicks.

3. **Predictable Pricing**:
* Lightsail uses a straightforward pricing model with fixed monthly costs, allowing users to predict their expenses easily.

4. **Integrated Networking**: 
* Lightsail includes built-in networking features, such as static IP addresses, DNS management, and load balancing, to help users manage their applications more effectively.

Overall, Amazon Lightsail is an excellent choice for users who want a simple and cost-effective way to deploy and manage applications in the cloud without the complexity of traditional cloud services.

```
Sweety is a blogger who wants to write a blog. 
She is considering using Amazon Lightsail to host her blog because it offers a simple and 
cost-effective solution for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.
With Lightsail's easy-to-use interface and preconfigured application stacks,
Sweety can quickly set up her blog without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
Additionally, the predictable pricing model allows her to manage her expenses effectively as her blog grows.

She is a simple blogger and not a cloud engineer who will manage EC2 instances to host her blog and manage databases.

< AWS Lambda > Serverless Computing - It is for developers

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
It automatically scales applications by running code in response to events, such as changes in data or system state.

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: 
* Lambda functions are triggered by events from other AWS services, such as S3 uploads, DynamoDB updates, or API Gateway requests.

2. **Automatic Scaling**: 
* Lambda automatically scales the number of function instances in response to incoming requests, ensuring consistent performance without manual intervention.

3. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**: 
* With Lambda, you only pay for the compute time consumed by your functions, making it a cost-effective solution for variable workloads.

4. **Supports Multiple Languages**: 
* Lambda supports various programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, and C#, allowing developers to use their preferred language.  

/Lambda_Function
+ A Lambda function is a small, single-purpose function that runs in response to events. It can be written in any supported programming language and can access other AWS services.
+ Ravi was curious Developer, he was told not to launch EC2 instances at midnight. However, Ravi at midnight was trying to launch EC2 instances but it was getting terminated repeatedly.
+ Reyaz had created a Lambda function which terminated the instances Ravi created.
( Event-Driven Architecture: Lambda functions are triggered by events from other AWS services, such as S3 uploads, DynamoDB updates, or API Gateway requests.)
