< S3 - Simple Storage Service >
S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
- S3 is just to store your files. S3 is used to store FLAT Files. With S3, you can upload/download and access your files just like Google Drive.

- Folder in S3 is called a "Bucket". A bucket is a container for storing objects (files) in S3.
- File in S3 is called an "Object". An object consists of the file data and metadata, such as the file name and size.
- Bucket (folder) is a container for storing objects (files) in S3.

# S3 is cheaper than EC2
# You can't run applications, execute code, or perform computations on S3. You can just store files nothing more. 
# You can't attach S3 to EC2 instances directly to install OS.
# S3 supports static website hosting (HTML, CSS, JS files only).

* S3 is serverless. No need to worry about performance, High Availability, Scalability, etc. AWS will take care of all these things.
* S3 is object based storage, meaning it stores data as objects within buckets. - Certification Question
* S3 is unlimited storage, allowing you to store as much data as you need without worrying about running out of space.

< Elastic Block Store (EBS) >

EBS is a block based storage service that provides persistent storage for EC2 instances. 
It is designed for workloads that require low-latency access to data and is suitable 
for use cases such as databases, file systems, and applications that require frequent read/write access to data.

* EBS volumes are attached to EC2 instances and can be used as primary storage for the instance.
* EBS provides the ability to create snapshots, which are point-in-time backups of the volume that can be used for disaster recovery or to create new volumes.
* EBS volumes can be resized and modified without downtime, allowing for flexible storage management.
* EBS is designed for high availability and durability, with data automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones.
* You can install applications and databases on EBS volumes, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.
# Hard Disk = Volume = EBS Volume
+ EBS is huge, it can go up to 64 TB in size per volume. Create one volume then attach that EBS Volume to your EC2 instance. 
+ You can attach and detach volumes from EC2 instances as needed, allowing for flexible storage management. On-premises, this would require physically moving disks between servers.
+ Can you attach multiple volumes to EC2 instances? Yes, you can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2 instance, allowing for increased storage capacity and performance.

Client Side Operating System ~ Windows 7 , 10, 11, Linux Desktop, MAC, Android
Server Side Operating System ~ Windows Server, Linux Server

" EC2 instance has a default volume and that is called ROOT Volume, The Root volume has OS installed on it (Windows or Linux)." 
" How many Root volumes can EC2 have? 1 only." Rest of the volumes are called 'Additional Volumes'. 

"Can you attach single EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances? No, you cannot attach a single EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances at the same time."
* Volumes should be pre-provisioned before they can be attached to EC2 instances. Meaning you need to create the volume first before you can attach it to an instance.
* No auto-scaling for EBS volumes. You need to manually manage the size and performance of your EBS volumes.
* Volume size can be increased on the FLY (no need to shutdown EC2 instance).
* Volume size can't be decreased directly without detaching the volume.

// Root volume device name is always /dev/sda1 or /dev/xvda (Linux). 
// Additional volume device name is always /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc or /dev/sdd or /dev/sde or /dev/sdf or /dev/xvdf (Linux).

# Is it possible to detach the root volume while EC2 is running?
+ No, it is not possible to detach the root volume while the EC2 instance is running.
+ The root volume is essential for the instance's operation, and detaching it would cause the instance to become inaccessible.
+ In order to detach the root volume, you must stop the EC2 instance first. Once the instance is stopped, you can detach the root volume and then start the instance again.

# Is it possible to detach the additional volume while EC2 is running?
+ Yes, it is possible to detach the additional volume while the EC2 instance is running.
+ However, it is recommended to unmount the volume from the operating system before detaching it to avoid data loss.
+ Not recommended to detach the volume while it is in use by an application, as this could lead to data corruption.

// EC2 instance has Availability Zones, EBS volumes also have Availability Zones. 
// EC2 instance and EBS volume must be in the same Availability Zone to attach the volume to the instance. // "very important certification exam question"

* 1a and 1b EC2 instances of ap-southeast-1 have EBS volumes 1q and 1r respectively. Can you attach 1q to 1b? No, because they are in different Availability Zones. *
# Creating and Attaching should be same availability zone.
