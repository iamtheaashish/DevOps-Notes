< IAM ~ Identity and Access Management >
- IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.
- You can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.
- IAM enables you to grant different levels of access to different users, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.
- It supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security.
- IAM is integrated with many AWS services, making it easy to manage access across your AWS environment.
* One main company AWS account and multiple IAM users and roles can be created to manage access to AWS resources.
