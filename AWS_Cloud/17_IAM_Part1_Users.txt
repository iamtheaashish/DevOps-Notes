# This note is about IAM Users in AWS. Thanks to Reyaz Sir and Shaik Ashish.
# IAM means Identity and Access Management.

< IAM Users - Deep Dive >
+ IAM is completely free. AWS will not charge for using IAM.
+ IAM is used for security purpose. IAM allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
+ With IAM, you can control centrally the entire AWS environment and manage user access to resources.
+ Is it possible to share AWS root account ? Yes but with IAM Roles. Don't share Email and Password. Idiot
+ IAM user has limited permissions/policies compared to the root user.
+ For IAM users you can attach or detach the policies or permissions anytime.
+ IAM is global.
+ It is not recommended to use root account for daily activities, instead use IAM users.

> Difference between AWS Root User and IAM Admin User
+ IAM Admin will not have BILLING and related permissions.

< Global and Regional Permissions >
- Global permissions apply to all AWS regions, while regional permissions apply only to a specific region.
- IAM policies can be created to grant permissions at both the global and regional levels.
- It is important to understand the scope of permissions when designing your IAM policies to ensure they align with your security requirements.
- There are few services that are regional and cannot be accessed globally, such as Amazon S3 buckets configured with specific region settings.
- There are few services that are global and can be accessed from any region, such as Amazon CloudFront.

* USE MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) to secure your AWS environment. Generated in your PHONE.
* MFA is for both root account and IAM users.

There are two types of Access in AWS: 
1.) **Programmatic Access** (via API, CLI, SDK) 
2.) **AWS Management Console Access** (via web interface)

API means Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
CLI means Command Line Interface. It allows users to interact with the AWS services using command-line commands.
SDK means Software Development Kit. It provides a set of tools and libraries for developers to build applications that interact with AWS services.

/Programmatic_Access
You login with access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).

/Management_Console_Access
You login with your username and password. In Browser.
