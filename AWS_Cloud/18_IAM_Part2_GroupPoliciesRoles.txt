# This note is about IAM Groups, Policies, and Roles in AWS. Thanks to Reyaz Sir and Shaik Ashish.
Two Types of Access in AWS:
1.) **Programmatic Access** (via API, CLI, SDK) -----------------------> Keys are required. 
2.) **AWS Management Console Access** (via web interface)

`We have to share keys for programmatic access to IAM users. Every IAM user has their own keys.`
`Create keys only when there is requirement. Not unnecessarily.`
`Keys also have the same permissions like console access.`
`Every IAM user can have maximum 2 set of keys.`
`Keys are visible only at the time of creation.`
