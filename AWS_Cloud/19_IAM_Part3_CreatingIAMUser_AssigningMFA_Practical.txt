< IAM Tags >
Tags help organize and manage IAM resources by adding metadata to them.
You can use tags to categorize users, groups, roles, and policies based on your organization's needs.
`Tags are Key Value Pair. They are used for identification, automation, cost optimization purpose.`
`It helps in resource management and cost allocation.`

For each resource, you can add maximum of 50 tags. 

/Example: you write a script to delete IAM users based on specific tags, you can easily identify and target those users using the tags you've assigned.
Otherwise, you would have to manually search for users, which can be time-consuming and error-prone."
