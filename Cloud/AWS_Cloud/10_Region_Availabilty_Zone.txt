# This note is about AWS Regions and Availability Zones. Thanks to Reyaz Sir and Shaik Ashish.

< Region is a geographical area that contains multiple data centers. Example: Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region (ap-south-1), Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) region (ap-south-2). >
+ Each region is isolated and independent from other regions, providing fault tolerance and stability.
+ AWS has multiple regions worldwide, allowing users to choose the best location for their resources based on latency, compliance, and cost.

* Question: As a business, your customers are in India. Which AWS region should you choose to serve them best?
 Answer: You should choose the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region (ap-south-1) to serve your customers in India best. 
 With least latency and compliance with local regulations, this region is optimized for Indian customers.

 We choose region outside India, we won't have any problem, but we may face higher latency and potential compliance issues.

 < Always Low latency is good compared to High latency. Choosing Region near our customers provides low latency and low response time. >
--------
$ In One REGION, there are multiple Availability Zones (AZs) that are isolated from each other to prevent failures from impacting other zones.
$ Availability Zones are nothing but data centers within a region, each with its own power, cooling, and physical security.

Regions has multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to provide high availability and fault tolerance. Or Region has multiple data centers (AZs) to ensure redundancy and reliability.
If one AZ goes down, the others can take over, ensuring that applications remain available.

* Example: In the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region (ap-south-1), there are multiple AZs, such as ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b, and ap-south-1c.
* Minimum of 2 AZs are required for high availability. There are regions like North Virginia (us-east-1) that have 6 AZs.

"One Availability Zone (AZ) is not a single data center. It is a collection of data centers within a specific geographic area.
For customer it seems like one AZ is a single data center. AZ is a group of data centers itself."

# Inside Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region (ap-south-1):
1a = Bandra, Juhu, Dadar
1b = Andheri, Borivali, Malad
1c = Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan
Total = 3 AZs
Total = 9 data centers

* It's a rare chance that all AZs in a region go down at the same time. It's a rare chance that all data centers in an AZ go down at the same time.

`Network in Region`
1. All availability zones in a region can talk to each other with high bandwidth, low latency, and secure connections. 
2. Network is synchronized across AZs, allowing for seamless failover and redundancy. 
3. Data is not replicated across AZs by default, so it's important to design applications with this in mind.

!!! Network is synchronized not Data !!!
!!! Region don't talk to each other by default. We need to set up VPC Peering or AWS Transit Gateway for inter-region communication. !!!
========
# If you put data in 1a, you can't see it in 1b or 1c without setting up inter-region communication.
* What is DR (Disaster Recovery)?
- Disaster Recovery (DR) is a set of policies and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster. 
- In the context of AWS, DR involves replicating data and applications across multiple regions or availability zones to ensure business continuity in the event of a failure.
========
In AWS we call server as instance.
========
" Although AWS is public cloud, it allows you to create a private cloud within it using VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). "
* By default, two VPC can't talk to each other. We need to set up VPC Peering or AWS Transit Gateway for inter-VPC communication.
# Inside VPC, we have multiple AZ, each AZ can have multiple instances.

$ What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?
1. A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
2. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

Sulabh Shauchalya complex is Public (AWS), compartments in Sulabh Shauchalya complex are like VPCs, and each compartment can have multiple instances (servers).

- VPC is a security boundary that isolates resources within the AWS cloud.

// Load Balancer can distribute the traffic to multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). \\

// AutoScaling can scaleout the instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) based on demand. \\
