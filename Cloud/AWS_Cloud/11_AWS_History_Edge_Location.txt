# This note is about AWS History and Edge Locations. Thanks to Reyaz Sir and Shaik Ashish.

* Invention requires two things:
1. The ability to try a lot of experiments.
2. Not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments.
* AWS was started in 2003, launched in 2006. Failures are stepping stones to success.
===========
< Brief History of AWS>
- in 2003 - Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black present a paper on what Amazon's own internal infrastructure should look like.
- They suggested selling it as a service and prepared a business case.
- SQS or Simple Queue Service was one of the first services to be launched in 2004.
- AWS officially launched in 2006.
- 2007 over 180,000 developers on AWS platform.
- 2010 all of amazon.com moved over.
- 2012 First re:Invent conference held. Also AWS Edge Locations were announced.
- 2013 Certification Launched
- 2014 AWS Lambda announced. Committed to achieve 100% renewable energy usage for it's global infrastructure by 2020.
- 2015 AWS revenue surpassed $7 billion.
- 2016 AWS revenue surpassed $12 billion.
- 2017 AWS revenue surpassed $17 billion.
- 2018 AWS revenue surpassed $25 billion.
- 2019 AWS revenue surpassed $35 billion.
- 2020 AWS revenue surpassed $45 billion.

> AWS is secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage,
content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.

> AWS offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, 
and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications.

"What is Edge Locations?"
* Edge Location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to cache copies of your content for faster delivery to users at any location.
* When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that can best serve the content, 
* which is typically the nearest edge location to the user.
* CloudFront has a global network of edge locations, allowing it to deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds.
* It will cache based on time to live (TTL) settings that you configure.
* Edge Locations are completely managed by AWS. Just little bit of configuration is needed from your side.
+ Cache Invalidation
  - You can invalidate cached content in an edge location if you need to update it before the TTL expires.
  - This allows you to control the content that is served to users and ensure they receive the latest version.
  - Invalidation is simply deleting the cached content from the edge location.
* Edge Locations are mostly used for static content like images, videos, web pages, etc. for reading purposes.

+ Example: Netflix uses edge location to cache most watched web series and movies of that region for faster streaming with low latency.

"What is AWS CloudFront?"
* AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, 
* and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.
* CloudFront integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, EC2, and Lambda, to provide a seamless content delivery experience.
* With CloudFront, you can configure your content delivery settings, including caching behaviors, security features, and access controls, 
* to meet your specific requirements.
# CloudFront has Edge Location and Edge Locations are connected with CDN

"What is the difference between AWS Region, Availability Zone, and Edge Location?"
* AWS Region is a geographical area that contains a collection of data centers. 
* Each region is isolated from other regions to provide fault tolerance and stability.
* Availability Zone is a distinct location within a region that is engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. 
* Each region has multiple Availability Zones.
* Edge Location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to cache copies of your content for faster delivery to users at any location.
