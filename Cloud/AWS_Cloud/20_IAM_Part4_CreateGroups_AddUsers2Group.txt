< What Does DevOps Engineers do in company? >
- Let's say we have 3 Developers in our company. We have 3 servers (ec2 instances).
- Each Developer is responsible for deploying their code (patches of application, bugs fixed) to their respective server.
- DevOps Engineers facilitate this process by implementing CI/CD pipelines, automating deployments, and ensuring that the infrastructure is scalable and reliable.

- Developers will push the code to a shared repository (e.g., Git, GitHub, Bitbucket), and the CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy  to the appropriate server.
- This allows for faster development cycles and more reliable deployments.
- But first DevOps engineer will validate the code, test it and build it (build stage) using softwares like Maven, Jenkins, Gradle etc.. If the build is successful,
- Entire code will be zipped (artifact) and stored in a repository (e.g. JFrog, Nexus, Artifactory) for deployment. 

- Now DevOps Engineer can deploy the application from the artifact repository to the deployment server using Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Terraform or Ansible.
- This process is automated using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI etc. And you can deploy to N number of servers simultaneously.

$ CI CD Pipeline:
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key practices in DevOps that enable teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. 
CI involves automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository, while CD focuses on automating the deployment of those changes to production environments.


< AWS Code Commit >
* It is a fully managed source control service that makes it easy for teams to host secure and scalable Git repositories.
* AWS CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure.
* It is like a replacement to GitHub or Bitbucket.

* AWS CodeCommit is designed to work seamlessly with other AWS services, making it easy to integrate into your existing workflows.
* It provides features like automatic scaling, high availability, and built-in security controls to protect your code.

< S3 to store artifacts >
* Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service that is commonly used to store and retrieve artifacts in a CI/CD pipeline.
* S3 can be used to store build artifacts, such as compiled code, Docker images, and other files generated during the build process.
* By using S3 to store artifacts, teams can easily manage and version their builds, as well as share them across different stages of the pipeline.
* It is added benefit to Nexus, JFrog or Artifactory.

`Amazon S3 cannot fully replace Sonatype Nexus Repository, but it can be used as the underlying storage for Nexus.`

< AWS Code Deploy >
* AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services, including Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Fargate, and on-premises servers.
* It helps teams release new features quickly and reliably by automating the deployment process, reducing the risk of errors, and enabling rollbacks if needed.
* CodeDeploy integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS CodePipeline, to create a complete CI/CD workflow.

`Cannot fully replace traditional deployment methods, but it provides a more efficient and reliable way to manage deployments in the cloud.`

< AWS Code Build >
* AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.
* It eliminates the need to provision and manage your own build servers, allowing you to focus on writing code.
* CodeBuild scales automatically to meet your build volume, so you can build and test your code quickly and efficiently.

`AWS CodeBuild does not replace Maven; rather, it integrates with and leverages Maven as a build tool within its managed build environments.`

< AWS Code Pipeline >
* AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates.
* It enables you to model your software release process as a series of stages, including build, test, and deploy.
* CodePipeline integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy, to create a complete CI/CD workflow.

`AWS CodePipeline does not replace traditional CI/CD tools; rather, it integrates with and enhances them within the AWS ecosystem.`
