`PAT is used for authentication when accessing GitHub repositories from the command line or other Git clients. PAT means Personal Access Token.
Password authentication was removed in August 2021. Now, users must use PATs or SSH keys for authentication.`

* What is the difference between Branch and Tag?
  - Branch: A branch is a pointer to a specific commit in the repository. It allows you to work on different versions of the code simultaneously.
  - Branch is Mutable: You can make changes to a branch, commit those changes, and even delete or rename the branch.
  - Tag: A tag is a reference to a specific point in the repository's history, often used to mark release points (e.g., v1.0, v2.0).
  - Tag is Immutable: Once a tag is created, it cannot be changed or moved to point to a different commit.

` In summary, branches are used for development and can change over time, while tags are used for marking specific points in history and remain constant.`

Interview Questions: Tags are created on which Branch? 
< Tags can be created on any branch, but they are often created on the main or master branch to mark specific releases or important points in the project's history. >

$ git tag
$ git tag <tagname>
$ git push <alias_name> tag <tagname>
# <tagname> is the name of the tag you want to push, This command pushes the specified tag to the remote repository.
