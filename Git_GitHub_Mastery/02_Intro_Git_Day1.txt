< Very Interesting Story of Git >
Back in the days when Linus hadn't created Git, there was a project called BitKeeper which was a proprietary version control system.
The Linux kernel community used BitKeeper for version control, but it was not open source.
In 2005, the relationship between the Linux community and BitMover (the company behind BitKeeper) soured when BitMover decided to restrict the free use of BitKeeper for open source projects.
This led to a situation where the Linux community needed an alternative version control system.

BitMover had previously offered a free version of BitKeeper to open source developers, but they changed their policy, which caused significant disruption.

In response to this, Linus Torvalds decided to create a new version control system that would be open source and meet the needs of the Linux kernel development community.

As per Linus, full form of git is "Stupid content tracker"
but it is also a recursive acronym for "Global Information Tracker"
+ Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every developer has a full copy of the repository on their local machine.

"When you go deeper in an Onion and in Unix, You get tears."
Onion has a kernel, Linux has a kernel too.
=====
* Git is an application that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects efficiently.
Git is nothing but a command line application. Based on arguments I pass, it takes some decisions. 
=====
The reason why Docker works at all is because of Linux Kernel. Linux is all because of Unix. 
1. Every Linux operating system has to comply with the standards set by (Richard Stallman) and the Free Software Foundation. He gave postulates for free software.
2. MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.
3. It provides a set of tools and libraries that allow developers to create Windows applications using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and other GNU tools. 
4. Git Bash works because of MinGW.
# Linus Torvalds refer book by Maurice J. Bach's "Design of the Unix Operating System".
$ cd . vs cd ..
# The command 'cd .' refers to the current directory, while 'cd ..' refers to the parent directory. 
# '.' are environment variables/blocks that refer to the current directory, while '..' are environment variables/blocks that refer to the parent directory.
