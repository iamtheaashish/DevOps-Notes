# This note is about Distributed Version Control taught by Mohit Dharmadhikari (thanks to codebuddy/hangoutbuddy).
# In this note, we will understand how Git actually manages everything.

* Distributed means multiple machines
- Basically Version Control is like a time tracker with a timeline.

What is the outcome of DevOps process? from technical perspective
as Engineers you should be able to justify what we do. Knowing what's going inside will help us take critical decisions.

`In India even a pharmacist can prescribe Loose motion medication. But only the doctor know 'WHY' there is a need of Loose Motion Medication, what wrong happened that the patient need medication.`
We have to become a DOCTOR DevOps engineer and not a Pharmacist DevOps engineer.
Pharmacist DevOps Engineer will only know to fire commands without DEEPLY understanding the technology.

```Hashing is an Algorithm that need to satisy those 4 conditions, Variable Input, Fixed Output, Deterministic, Fast to compute.
SHA1 is a popular hashing algorithm that produces a 160-bit hash value, typically rendered as a 40-digit hexadecimal number.
earlier git was using MD5 but now it is using SHA1.
SHA256 is another hashing algorithm that produces a 256-bit hash value, typically rendered as a 64-digit hexadecimal number. 

Latest Git version is using SHA256.
These keys are used to uniquely identify commits and ensure data integrity within the Git repository. 
It increases security by making it computationally infeasible to generate the same hash from different inputs (collision resistance).```

Git Bash is not Git. Git Bash is a program that stores environment variables and provides a command-line interface for interacting with Git repositories.
